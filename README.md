# CS598 Deep Learning for Healthcare - Final Project - DeepMicro: Deep Representation Learning for Disease Prediction based on Microbiome Data

This repository implements [Oh, M., & Zhang, L. (2020). DeepMicro: deep representation learning for disease prediction based on microbiome data. Scientific reports, 10(1), 6026.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63159-5).


## Prerequisites

Python version 3.10.12

## Install Packages

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZKingQ/CS598-DLH-SP24.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd CS598-DLH-SP24
```

3. Install the required packages from the requirements.txt 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training
Follow the steps outlined in the DLH_Team_71_PyTorch.ipynb notebook to run the project in [Run Experiments](https://github.com/ZKingQ/CS598-DLH-SP24/blob/main/DLH_Team_71_PyTorch.ipynb/#run-experiments) section
. Make sure you have installed and downloaded all the required packages and datasets.

```python
run_experiment()
```

## Evaluation

The evaluation codes are embedded in the `classification` function and the evaluation metrics are saved in path `\result\`.
